## Hi, I'm Rachid

Welcome to my blog! This is my digital notebook where I document my journey learning cybersecurity, penetration testing, and solving CTF challenges.

## What You'll Find Here

- **CTF Writeups**: Detailed solutions to Capture The Flag challenges
- **Pentesting Labs**: Walkthroughs of practice machines (HTB, THM, etc.)
- **Learning Notes**: Things I discover while studying security topics
- **Tools & Techniques**: Security tools and methodologies I'm exploring

## Why I Write

I believe in learning in public. Writing helps me:
- Solidify my understanding
- Create a reference for future me
- Help others who are on the same path
