[{"content":"Introduction Before we start, I need to say that this is my first ever writeup and also my first CTF, so I hope you enjoy it.\nFor a working environment, you can go to simple ctf and run the machine. You can use your own machine as an attack box using OpenVPN, or you can just stick to the attack box provided in the room for a simple setup like I did. Now let\u0026rsquo;s start.\nScanning nmap -sCV MACHINE_IP How many services are running under port 1000?\n2\nWhat is running on the higher port?\nssh\nInitial Access So now from scanning we know that the server is running three services (ssh, ftp, http), and Anonymous FTP login is allowed.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with http:\nIf we check http://MACHINE_IP in the browser, we found nothing but the default Apache web page.\nWe need to go deeper. We can use gobuster to check for subdirectories.\ngobuster dir -u http://MACHINE_IP -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt We found a subdirectory called /simple/. Now if we go to the URL, we see this page.\nA little bit of research on the page and we found that this website uses a CMS called \u0026ldquo;CMS Made Simple\u0026rdquo;, so maybe we can exploit that.\nIf we check exploit database, we found a CVE.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the CVE you\u0026rsquo;re using against the application?\nCVE-2019-9053\nTo what kind of vulnerability is the application vulnerable?\nsqli\nSo we\u0026rsquo;re gonna use this CVE to exploit the site. The script provided in the PoC is Python 2. We\u0026rsquo;re gonna use a new version, Python 3.\nUpdated version of the exploit script:\ngit clone https://github.com/Mahamedm/CVE-2019-9053-Exploit-Python-3.git cd CVE-2019-9053-Exploit-Python-3/ pip install -r requirement.txt Now we are ready to crack the system.\npython3 csm_made_simple_injection.py -u http://MACHINE_IP/simple -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --crack Run the script and wait. Yay, we done it! We get the password and username.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the password?\nsecret\nWhere can you login with the details obtained?\nssh\nNow using the username and password we discovered, we can now try to SSH into the target machine.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the user flag?\nG00d j0b, keep up!\nIs there any other user in the home directory? What\u0026rsquo;s its name?\nsunbath\nPrivilege Escalation sudo -l Note: sudo -l lists what commands the current user is allowed to run with sudo privileges\nWhat can you leverage to spawn a privileged shell?\nvim\nsudo vim -c \u0026#39;!sh\u0026#39; What\u0026rsquo;s the root flag?\nW3ll d0n3. You made it!\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s it, we made it! I hope you enjoyed this writeup.\n","permalink":"https://raciod.github.io/posts/simple-ctf-tryhackme/","summary":"My first CTF writeup!
